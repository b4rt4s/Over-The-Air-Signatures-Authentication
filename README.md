# Over-The-Air-Signatures-Authentication

<p align="justify">
Over-The-Air-Signatures-Authentication is a conceptual system for an engineering thesis. The system includes scripts for collecting signature data, extracting features, and applying both custom and standard machine learning classifiers from scikit-learn. These classifiers are used to compare signatures after the feature extraction process. The project will be developed further as needed.
